Week 09 - Utilities and Modules
---
This week we worked on getting to know some of pythons different modules. We built a script which can clone all the repositories of a github user into a folder locally on the computer. We also built a web crawler which should be able to download the entire content of a webpage, and get it to work locally. 
We worked with the modules:
- os
- subprocess
- requests
- and we created our own module and imported it

Week 08 - Data structures and functions
---
This week we had about the different data structures (lists, dictionaries and tuples). We also worked with opening and closing files, and we made some functions which could read the content of a file into a dictionary and be able to sort them depending on how many times it had been in the text.

Week 06 - Introduction
---
The first week we learned about strings (splitting, concatenating, joining etc.) and worked on getting a better understanding of the command line and unix commands
